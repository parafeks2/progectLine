00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,760

00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,216

3
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,400
<i>Like, he sort of asked for it.</i>

4
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,120
<i>This is an all-boys school.
What did he expect?</i>

5
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,680
<i>He's so gross.</i>

6
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,120
<i>I bet he was looking at us
in the changing room.</i>

7
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,440
- <i>I'd rather be dead than be gay.</i>
- Charlie.

8
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,880
<i>He's looking at us.</i>

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,120
<i>What a weirdo.</i>

10
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,000

42
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,120
Hi.

43
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,200
So I, um, heard about you
coming out last term.

44
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,240
Um, yeah, I guess.

45
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,000
That was really brave.

46
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,320
Well, it wasn't really my...

47
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,880
It sort of just got found out.

48
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,240
No one was supposed to know.

49
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,800
Well, you're brave
for putting up with all the negativity.

50
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,440
I guess so.

51
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,440
I'm Ben.

52
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,160
How are you doing, Elle?

53
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,080
Hmm?

54
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,000
I've noticed you haven't made
friends in your form group.

55
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,520
It's not easy moving schools
in the middle of Year 11.

56
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,480
I'm fine.

57
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,080
I could assign Tara Jones
to look after you?

58
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,720
No, no, I'm fine.
I promise, I don't want to bother anyone.

59
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,560
Okay, look. It's half-term next week.

60
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,880
How about you promise me

61
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,440
you'll try to make
at least one new friend before then?

62
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,840
Okay. Maybe.

73
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,960
He's straight, Charlie.

74
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,520
Like, you only need to glance at him
to see that he's a heterosexual.

75
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,840
Isaac, back me up on this.

76
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,880
Ginormous heterosexual.

77
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,840
Exactly.

78
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,440
Masculine guys can be gay.

79
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,600
You're not exactly the authority
on working out who is and isn't gay.

80
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,960
And bisexual people exist.

81
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,440
I know he's straight. He told me.

82
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,160
So, you need to get over him.

83
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,640
- Mr. Ajayi.
- Charlie Spring.

84
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
I have a question.

85
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,920
Well, I am officially
a beacon of learning, so, fire away.

86
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,400
How do I stop liking someone?
A straight guy.

87
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,000
Uh, the question for the ages.
I thought you had a boyfriend.

88
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,440
No. No, he was horrible.
This is someone else.

89
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,400
Wow. Being a teenager is terrible.

90
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,960
When I was a teenager
and had a crush on a straight boy,

91
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,520
I repressed it and suffered.

92
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,880
- That doesn't sound very healthy.
- Mmm.

93
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,320
Now, this may seem obvious,

94
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,880
but have you tried
putting some space between you?

95
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,919
- Can't do that.
- Can't or don't want to?

96
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,360
- Nope.
- I'm just saying...

97
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,200
I needed realistic solutions.

98
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,320
He's... He's a really good friend.

99
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,200
I'm afraid you're just
going to have to suffer then.

100
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,920
- Elle, you dropped your pencil case.
- Oh. Thanks, Tara.

101
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,720
It's really cute, where's it from?

102
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,120
Paperchase, but I painted
all the little flowers on it.

103
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,600
Really? That's so cool.
I can barely draw stick figures.

104
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,280
Do you want to meet up
with us for lunch today?

105
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,520
Did Miss Greenwood tell you
to try and make friends with me?

106
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,160
Uh... No.

107
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,480
We eat in the canteen,
so you can join us any time.

108
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,680
Hey. You okay?

109
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,920
Morning, Tara.

110
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,480
Did you finish your project?

111
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,440
- No.
- No?

112
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,600
I'm not even gonna
lie to you at this point.

113
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,360
You know it's due fourth period.

114
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
Yeah.

115
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,000
Wait, look.

116
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,680
Elle!

117
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,720
Hi.

118
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
So, Tara said you had no friends.

119
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,920
I didn't say that.

120
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,160
Monster Munch?

121
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,360
Yeah, okay.

122
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,400
So, you moved schools from Truham?

123
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,240
Yeah, Truham was just hell for me, so...

124
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,240
I mean, it was hell for almost everyone,
but, like, especially me.

125
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,520
I kept getting suspended
because of my hair length.

126
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,160
- Hair length?
- Yeah.

127
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,560
They have this stupid
"chin length or above" rule.

128
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,240
- Have you been finding it any better here?
- Yeah, it's a lot less stressful.

129
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,640
Apart from the whole
"having no friends" issue.

130
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,080
Don't worry, most people here are nice.
Just don't do anything Darcy says.

131
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,120
She'll have you taking part

132
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,440
in lunchtime games of American football
in the Science corridor.

133
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,640
Have you two been friends for a long time?

134
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,200
- Mmm...
- Best gal pals.

135
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,560
Since Year 7, so five years of hell.

136
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,640
Can't eat that now, can I?

137
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,400
This is Nellie.

138
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,960
Oh, my God, she's so cute.

139
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,120
I wish I had a dog.
My parents don't like animals.

140
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,080
You should come
round my house and meet her.

141
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,440
Are you free on Saturday?

142
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,400
Yeah, I think so.

143
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,120
Hi.

144
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,800
God, Tori.

145
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,200
Where you going?

146
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,120
Round a friend's.

147
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,280
Tao's?

148
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,720
No, his... His name's Nick.

149
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,080
Is my hair too short?

150
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,320
It looks the same.

151
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,320
But is it okay?

152
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,000
It looks the same.

153
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,520
Great. Thanks.

154
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,080
Have fun at Nick's.

155
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,440
Hey.

156
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,520
Hey.

157
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,280
Uh... This is Nellie.

158
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,200
Hey, Nellie. You're so adorable.

159
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,760
- You got a haircut.
- Um...

160
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,400
Is it... Is it bad?

161
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,120
No, you look...

162
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,160
It looks great.

163
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,400
Okay, you'd better come in or Nellie
will think we're going for a walk.

164
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,480
Okay.

165
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,400
- I'm in the lead.
- You're not going to win.

166
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,600
Can you let me win one time?
You've won five or six games.

167
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,040
I'm going easy on you.

168
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,120
No.

169
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,800
- No!
- Yes!

170
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,320
How are you so good at this?

171
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,440
You get to be good at real sports,
I get to be good at fake ones.

172
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,760
- No, you're just good at everything.
- No, I'm not.

173
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,680
- You are. You're a proper little nerd.
- I'm not.

174
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,440
Let's see. You're good at video games.

175
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,360
Literally all school subjects,
but especially maths.

176
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,760
Playing the drums.

177
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,240
Befriending dogs,
and you are good at sports.

178
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
- Like, you run so fast...
- Shut up!

179
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,280
You know it's true. Get off me. Get off.

180
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,600
- Oh, my God.
- What?

181
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,240
It's snowing.

182
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,840
Okay, try this one.

183
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
It's a bit big.

184
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,520
That one looks good.

185
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,720
Nellie!

186
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,320
Come here.

187
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,120
Whoa-ho!

188
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,160
<i>♪ It's pretty fast but ♪</i>

189
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:00,920
<i>♪ This is what you do at parties, right? ♪</i>

190
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:09,040
<i>♪ And I know it's hard to tell ♪</i>

191
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:16,800
<i>♪ But I think I really like you ♪</i>

192
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,560
More! Come on. More!

193
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,600
Charlie seems like a lovely boy.
When did you meet him?

194
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,000
Uh...

195
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,920
Couple of months ago. Uh, he's in my form.

196
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,360
He's very different to your other friends.

197
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,480
You seem much more yourself around him.

198
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,160
Do I?

199
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
You do.

200
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
Oh.

201
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,320
Who are you texting?

202
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,280
Your mum?

203
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,960
Whoa. Great joke, Nicholas.
Who are you texting?

204
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,040
Don't.

205
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,120
- Come on, whose DMs have you slid into?
- I haven't. God.

206
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,000
Well, okay, fine.

207
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,560
He's definitely chirpsing someone.

208
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,120
Come on! Let's go!

209
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,000
What did I say?

210
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,680
Here we go then!

211
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,280
- Come on!
- Yes! Yes!

212
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,400
So... we're doing well.

213
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,920
Don't pretend you have any idea
you know what's going on.

214
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,319
Which end are we supposed
to be getting the ball to?

215
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,400
That end.

216
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,079
Nick scored most of the points.

217
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,920
Well, he is the Rugby King.

218
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,839
Yep.

219
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,359
- I wanted to talk to you about Nick.
- Yeah? Me too.

220
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,800
- Did you?
- Yeah.

221
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,040
Yeah.

222
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,160
Well... you know
how I thought he was straight?

223
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,240
Yes.

224
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,160
Well, I've kind of
been feeling like maybe he isn't.

225
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,680
Like he might like me back.

226
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,360
Oh.

227
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,040
There's been these little moments over
the past weeks and during the half-term.

228
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,760
We've been hanging out non-stop,

229
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,160
and he's been acting
a little bit flirty sometimes.

230
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,360
Obviously, I'm not getting my hopes up,
but I just think maybe there's a chance.

231
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,520
What?

232
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,560
Um...

233
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,680
What?

234
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,720
Nick likes a girl.

235
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,200
What?

236
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,120
Like, he's in love with a girl.

237
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Wha...

238
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,320
How do you know that?

239
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,360
Okay, I know how much you like him,
and I just don't want you to get hurt.

240
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,440
I decided to do
some digging over the half-term.

241
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,400
I messaged Otis, since I sort of know him,
and I know he's friends with Nick,

242
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,360
and I just slyly asked
if Nick was going out with anyone

243
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,920
because I might have
a friend who was interested.

244
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,160
He said that Nick's single,

245
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,320
but he's super interested
in this girl from the girls' school.

246
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,560
What girl?

247
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,640
Her name's Tara Jones.

248
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,640
Charlie!

249
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,680
Well done, team.

250
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,760
As your token straight friend,

251
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,960
it's my duty to remind you
that sometimes people are straight.

252
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,200
It's an unfortunate fact of life.

253
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,560
We don't know
if she actually likes Nick back.

254
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,280
I've already warned you about encouraging
Charlie's crushes on straight boys.

255
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,280
But I want to believe in romance.
Elle! So there's this girl at Higgs

256
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,080
- who Nick's got a crush on?
- We've heard from multiple sources.

257
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,880
We don't know if they're a thing.
Can you talk to her?

258
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,360
Charlie won't give up on this straight boy
until we know for sure.

259
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,760
Oh, my God, be quiet.

260
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,800
Okay. Slowly. What do you want?

261
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,880
Do you know a girl called Tara Jones?

262
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,280
- Yeah.
- Can you ask her if she likes Nick Nelson?

263
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,080
Nick Nelson?
You might as well give up right now.

264
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,440
He's the straightest person
I have ever seen.

265
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,400
Thank you!

266
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,920
I don't know Tara that well.

267
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,600
I can't just go up to her
and ask her who she fancies.

268
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,680
And I'm too busy
being the cool, mysterious new girl

269
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,680
who everyone wants to hang out with.

270
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,800
I'm fine. It's honestly fine.
I'm just being an idiot.

271
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,880
Okay. Look, if and only if
I get the chance,

272
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,960
I'll ask her.

273
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,720
- Thank you!
- I'm making no promises.

274
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,080
Tao.

275
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,080
Come on...

276
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,360
There we go. Aw.

277
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,720
Ladies, come on.

278
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,640
We've got still 15 minutes

279
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,040
to practice talking about
friends and family.

280
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,360
Everyone get into pairs.

281
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,040
Hey, come sit here.

282
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,320
Can we be a group of three?

283
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,520
Oh, my God, yes, please.
Darcy's pronunciation is horrendous.

284
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
See?

285
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,440
Okay. Darcy...

286
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,560
Do you have a boyfriend?

287
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,320
Yes, I have a girlfriend.

288
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,880
<i>"Une"</i> makes it feminine,
so you'd be saying you have a girlfriend.

289
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,080
Uh, whoops.

290
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,320
Elle, your turn.

291
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,400
Okay.

292
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,600
Tara, do you have a boyfriend?

293
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,160
No, I don't have a boyfriend.

294
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,440
- What? It's true.
- I know.

295
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,680
Let's move away
from the boyfriend question.

296
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,120
Uh, Elle...

297
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,920
Do you have brothers or sisters?

298
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,280
Hey.

299
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,520
Sorry. I'm definitely straight,
like, I only like girls.

300
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,920
We should probably stop
being friends if you feel like that.

301
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Charlie.

302
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,920
What?

303
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,920
You just spaced out.

304
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,840
Oh.

305
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,640
What?

306
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,720
What's up?

307
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,440
Do you...

308
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,040
Do you want to come round my house?

309
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,080
- Knew it!
- Said it in your head.

310
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,040
That doesn't count!

311
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,160
- It totally counts.
- That completely doesn't count!

312
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,360
- You're rubbing off on me.
- You're worse.

313
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,280
I'm not. It does matter
if you said it because I won,

314
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,080
- but then you said you won because...
- I did win!

315
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,200
...you knew first,
but you didn't say it.

316
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,000
- I absolutely did!
- Um, hi.

317
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,360
I was just admiring Tara's hands.

318
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,920
Mine get super crusty
in the cold, but hers are really soft.

319
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,280
Darcy.

320
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,120
I'm sorry if I've got totally
the wrong idea here,

321
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,400
but are you two, like... dating?

322
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,400
Don't tell anyone, okay?

323
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,160
Only a few of our friends know,

324
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,000
but I think you're officially
part of the inner circle.

325
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,000
Also, "hers are really soft,"

326
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,640
that's the gayest excuse
I've heard in my life.

327
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,360
You've befriended the school lesbians.

328
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,160
Hey.

329
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,240
Hey.

330
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,200
You're terrible.

331
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,400
I'm trying.

332
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,880
Here, budge up, let me help.

333
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,160
There.

334
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,560
You're a pro now.

335
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,920
Um...

336
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,520
Well, that's probably cheating though.

337
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,320
I wish you didn't have to go.

338
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,200
I wish I didn't either.

339
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,680
You look so cuddly like that.

340
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,960
Do I?

341
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,040
Yeah.

342
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,400
Um...

343
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,240
Okay, see you Monday.

344
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,200
I don't think he's straight.
